# Twitterclone
Twitterclone is an app that is meant to function like Twitter. Users can sign up, login, write tweets, follow and unfollow other users, and tag other users in tweets. Users tagged in tweets will get notifications that go away once the user has seen the notifications on their notification page and hit refresh, or navigated to a different page. Just like Twitter, Twitterclone allows users who are not logged in to view individual tweets and user profiles; but users must be logged in to write tweets, view their homepage, or follow or unfollow other users.

I made this app as part of my participation in Kenzie Academy's software engineering program.
